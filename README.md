Key-Master 🔐: Creating & Understanding Keyloggers By NLOX Luis Calderon, Nicole Iovino, O'Shayia Langston. and Xiong Zheng

Report Overview 🗒️

Keyloggers, or keystroke loggers, are tools that record what a person types on a device. Because keyloggers can record and quickly identify sensitive information, they are a significant threat to cybersecurity. To protect yourself, it’s important to know what keyloggers are, how to prevent an attack and how to remove a keylogger if you are attacked. In an attempt to better understand keyloggers the team at NLOX has researched and created our own simple keylogger, for educational purposes, and will outline the process in this report.

Q1: The Problem / Opportunity 🎯

This report will detail what a keylogger is, how to create one, how it can be used by ethical / unethical hackers, and how to protect yourself/remove a keylogger should you suspect you have one.

Q2: Target Audience 👫

Students, employees, and lay persons (in order to protect yourself from threats its always best to understand how they work and operate). Parents (who may use keyloggers as a form of parental control). Information technology departments (can use keylogger software to troubleshoot issues on a device). Companies outside of the tech space (keylogger software is often used as part of employee monitoring software to help track employee productivity).

Q3: The Hypothesis / Relevance📒

At NLOX we believe:

IF we create more awareness of keyloggers and their uses

⬇️

THEN we can better protect individuals and organizations against keylogging attacks

⬇️

BECAUSE 82% of breaches involve a human element, so even basic knowledge is crucial to limiting and preventing these types of attacks.

With access to your personal information, malicious users can cause a lot of damage. It’s therefore important to protect yourself from keyloggers so you don’t become a victim. You can reduce the likelihood of an attack by learning what behaviors can make you vulnerable to keylogger attacks and what precautions can be taken. According to Verizon’s 2022 Data Breach Investigations Report, 82% of breaches involve a human element. By being aware of the dangers, you can bolster your cybersecurity in order to better protect yourself / your organization against keylogger attacks. This is why our team at NLOX found it so vital to create our own keylogger as a way to better understand its uses and threat potential.

Q4: Supportive Data 📊

Our presentation will not only go into detail on what a keylogger is but we will also demonstrate how to create one (image 2) and how it functions (image 1). Below you will find images of the script we created to make our own keylogger. This script is designed to only work and save a "log file" to the host machine and is intended to be used like a parental control for informative purposes only. *This process will be further elaborated on in our video presentation. We also intend to conduct extensive research on keyloggers usage in past known attacks such as "Darkhotel". a well-known keylogger malware attack that targeted unsecure Wi-Fi at hotels. While also making sure the presentation demonstrates the ethical uses of keyloggers.

Q5: The Result/Source Code 🧩

Our end will result will be an informative video presentation outlining our research. The presentation will outline our research on keyloggers. the steps we took to create our own, uses of keyloggers, and actions one can take against keyloggers. Roles: Nicole Iovino (Group Leader, Video editor), Luis Calderon (Scripting Examples Presentation), O'Shayia Langston (Ethical Uses of Keylogger), Xiong Zheng (Malware/Unethical Uses). Each team member will have a slide presenting a part of our groups overall research and created tools. The video will be between 3:00 - 5:00 minutes in length and displayed to our fellow classmates upon graduation.
